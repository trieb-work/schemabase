▲ [WARNING] Comparison with -0 using the "===" operator will also match 0

    ../../pkg/prisma/generated/client/runtime/index.js:13073:29:
      13073 │             } else if (x === -0) {
            ╵                              ~~

  Floating-point equality is defined such that 0 and -0 are equal, so "x === -0" returns true for both 0 and -0. You need to use "Object.is(x, -0)" instead to test for -0.
