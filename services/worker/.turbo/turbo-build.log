✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve "tslib"

    ../../node_modules/.pnpm/@chronark+prefixed-id@0.3.8/node_modules/@chronark/prefixed-id/src/index.js:3:24:
      3 │ const tslib_1 = require("tslib");
        ╵                         ~~~~~~~

  You can mark the path "tslib" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which will remove this error. You can also surround this "require" call with a try/catch block to handle this failure at run-time instead of bundle-time.

▲ [WARNING] Comparison with -0 using the "===" operator will also match 0

            ╵                              ~~

  Floating-point equality is defined such that 0 and -0 are equal, so "x === -0" returns true for both 0 and -0. You need to use "Object.is(x, -0)" instead to test for -0.
